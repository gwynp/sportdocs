[Fastball](https://tribecafilm.com/filmguide/fastball-2015) by Jonathon Hock makes it's debut tonight at Tribeca.

From the site: 
> Hank Aaron, Nolan Ryan, Bob Gibson, Derek Jeter, and a cast of 20 Hall of Famers discuss how the magic of baseball boils down to the 396 milliseconds it takes a 100 mph fastball to reach home plate. 

Ken Rosenthal has seen it, and clearly [likes it](http://www.foxsports.com/mlb/story/ken-rosenthal-notes-fastball-documentary-jonathan-hock-miami-marlins-mets-orioles-dodgers-041915)
> The film begins with Justin Verlander talking about the first time he threw 100 mph, and musing about how his fastball might have compared to Bob Fellerâ€™s. For the next 85 minutes, the subject is fastballs and only fastballs.

Looking forward to it's wider release.

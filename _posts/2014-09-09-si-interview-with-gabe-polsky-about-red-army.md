An interesting [chat with Gabe Polsky](http://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2014/09/08/qa-gabe-polsky-director-red-army).  He talks about the culture of the Soviet Hockey system, and is open about the ambivalnce many of the players now feel about the Soviet Hockey System.

> The interviews with Fetisov are intercut with what Herzog called “archival footage of great strangeness and beauty.” This footage shows Soviet hockey mastermind Anatoli Tarasov’s unconventional coaching strategies, such as commanding his young athletes to somersault across the ice and carry each other on their backs. There is also footage of Tarasov visiting chess grand masters and Bolshoi dancers to learn their techniques.

>Anything I wanted was a phone call away. Free cars. The keys to a dozen hideout flats all over the city. I bet twenty, thirty grand over a weekend and then I'd either blow the winnings in a week or go to the sharks to pay back the bookies.

Henry Hill (Goodfellas)

[Playing For The Mob](http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=playingforthemob) by Joe Lavine and Cayman Grant marks a new batch of 30 for 30's starting tonight.  It's the story of Henry Hill - the guy Goodfellas was based on - fixing BC basketball games in the 70's. There's apparently even an interview with Hill (who has since died) along with players and other gamblers.

Lavine has a good track record with Sports films, [Nine Innings from Ground Zero](https://vimeo.com/59358041) was excellent.  There's an interesting story about how he came to work with Grant on the ESPN site.

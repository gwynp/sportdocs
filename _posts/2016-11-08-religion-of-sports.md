Gotham Chopra has a new Documentary Series coming out on Nov 15th 2016 called ['The Religion of Sports'](http://religion-of-sports.com/)on Audience. Chopra has made one absolutely excellent film, The Little Master about Sachin Tendulkar.

He's joined for this project by Tom Brady and Michael Strahan as executive producers, which has led to some [nice coverage](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tom-brady-michael-strahan-team-924775).  It will look at Sports "through the lens of spirituality and religion", and will look at among other things Nascar, Soccer and eSports.  The similarities between sport and religion in certain instances are striking - soccer in Brazil, cricket in India so this is promising ground and Chopra obviously has a deep family connect with religion and spirituality.  Time will tell if it manages to meet it's goals but it will be worth watching to find out. 

I have to say - the trailer looks very nice.
